Bread Omellete Recipie
</h1>
<h4>
 A bread omelette is a popular, quick meal or snack that combines an omelette with bread slices. <br>It's made by cooking an egg mixture (with spices, onions, tomatoes, and sometimes chilies) on a pan, then placing bread <br>slices on top so they stick to the egg. The omelette and bread cook together, creating a filling, savory dish that’s often served with ketchup or chutney.<br> It’s commonly enjoyed as a street food in India and is popular for breakfast or as a light snack.<br>

 <strong> Instructions</strong>
 <ol>
<li>Prepare the Egg Mixture: In a bowl, whisk the eggs. Add chopped onion, green chili, tomato (if using), coriander leaves, salt, pepper, and a pinch of turmeric if you like. Mix well.</li>
<li>Cook the Omelette: Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat and add a little oil or butter. Pour half of the egg mixture onto the pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
<li>Add Bread Slices: Place the bread slices on top of the omelette mixture while it's still wet. Press gently so they stick.</li>
<li>Flip and Cook: When the omelette is mostly cooked on one side, carefully flip it with a spatula so the bread side faces down. Let it cook until the bread is toasted and the omelette is fully done.</li>
<li>Serve: Once golden and crispy, remove from the pan. Cut into halves if you like, and serve hot with ketchup or green chutney.</li>
